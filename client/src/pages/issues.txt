 1. Merge Parth <-- Anush
 2. No need as they are at the smae level.
 3. I AM USING THE HISTORY OBJECT FROM THE REACT ROUTER DOM. TO PASS THE STATE BETWEEN ROUTES.
 4. one issue in the Array union, function of the upate Doc is that the 1's call is being used in decrement but not in the UNION. this leaves us with  2 possible solutions: 
 > reading first and then pushing and then updatin.
 > using the map data structure and keys instead of the Arrays.
 
 the former one is way better but comes with a bit of an issue, with the last element being repaeted twice.
